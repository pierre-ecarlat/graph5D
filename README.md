This project contains a project I did for the [NII](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), to visualize efficiently 5D graphs (and, as much as possible, multi-dimensional graphs (4D, 6D, etc), using Unity and 3D mouse (not mandatory).

## Requirements
You will need Unity 5.6, and 5.5 should also be fully compatible.
